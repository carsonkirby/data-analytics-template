### This folder contains the raw data that was used in my final Data Wrangling project. Raw data refers to data that has not been cleaned yet. These are the files that I uploaded into my Jupyter notebook files and worked on to produce my final project. Here is a rundown of the contents of this folder:
#### 1. county_data.csv: This is the CSV file that was produced as a result of web scraping the Iowa State University website that contained Iowa Census information.
#### 2. income.csv: This CSV file was downloaded from the National Institute of Health website. It contains data about the annual household income in Iowa counties.
#### 3. rural_urban.csv: This CSV file was downloaded from the Iowa Data Center website. It contains data that classifies each Iowa county with a certain urban/rural divide (for example: 30% urban, 70% rural)
#### 4. unemployment.csv: This file was also downloaded from the National Institute of Health webiste. It contains the unemployment rate for each Iowa county (as of 2018-2022)
