## Final Data Wrangling Project
#### The contents of this folder contain the code for my final BAIS:3250 Data Wrangling project. In this project, I looked at Iowa county population data and analyzed the relationship it had with other demographic factors.
###  Instructions:
#### 1. The file titled 000_cdkirby_final_project is the file to start with. This file will run a web scrpaing process that results in a csv file (county_data.csv).
#### 2. The next file, 001_cdkirby_final_project is a file that will take you through the data cleaning process for this project. You will have to retreive additional csv files found in the raw data section of the data/final folder. This is data that was downloaded directly from the internet. Final data will contain csv files that resulted from the work completed in this project.
#### 3. 002_cdkirby_final_project is the final file of this project. This file contains the analysis and visualization portions of this project. Here, there will be numerous additional data frames (tables) and scatterplots created to find results to answer the questions I posed in my report.
